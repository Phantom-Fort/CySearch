# CySearch - An Enhanced Cybersecurity Tool Aggregator

## Overview

CySearch is an open-source project designed to crawl GitHub for cybersecurity tools, categorize them, and provide a searchable database for security researchers, pentesters, and enthusiasts. Unlike other platforms that focus solely on one area, CySearch aims to cover all areas of cybersecurity, making it the most comprehensive tool discovery platform.

## Features (MVP)

- **GitHub Scraper**: Extract cybersecurity-related repositories using the GitHub API.
- **Categorization Engine**: NLP-based classification of tools across multiple cybersecurity domains:
    - Data Forensics
    - Ethical Hacking
    - Mobile Hacking
    - Network Attacks
    - Vulnerability Assessment
    - Web AppSec
    - OSINT
    - Code Assessment
    - Malware Offense
    - IoT Security
    - Cryptography
    - Arsenal Lab
    - Hardware/Embedded Security
    - Malware Defense
    - Network Defense
    - Reverse Engineering
    - Smart Grid/Industrial Security
    - Cloud Security & Compliance
    - Threat Intelligence & SOC Tools
    - Blockchain & Web3 Security
- **Search & Filtering**: Find tools based on name, category, language, and popularity.
- **Download Instructions**: Parse README files for setup steps.
- **Web Interface**: React/Svelte-based frontend for easy access.
- **AI Announcements**: Automated Twitter/Discord bot for tool releases and trending updates.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI / Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / SQLite
- **Scraper**: Python (GitHub API, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy)
- **NLP**: OpenAI API, spaCy, or LangChain
- **Frontend**: React / Svelte
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/GCP
